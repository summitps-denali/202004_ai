Interesting Files

  - stable.js
    Never edit this, it is a known working bot file, though
    it does not do anything interesting.

  - server.js
    To test a bot file, need to have a server that will
    allow bot to connect to and run.  This means in two different
    terminal windows - server will be run in one terminal,
    bot will be run in a second window.
    To run this in a _seperate_ terminial.  
    $ node server.js
      [ use Ctrl C to stop ]

  - test.js
    This is a copy of stable.js.  Typically students will
    make edits in this file, or make copies with related names
    (ex: test2.js, cooltrick.js, debug.js, ...)
    To run this bot, open a terminal
    $ node test.js
      [ use Ctrl C to stop,
        ALWAYS stop this before stopping server ]
        
Arena Files

These files are specifically for use with a central arena server.  Check
with your lab manager if one is available.  Typically arena servers
expect at least four bot bee bot connections before it will allow
bee hive simulation to run.  Elimination trials can be conducted if
different users all target the same arena server.  

  - tsa1.js, tsa1.js, tsa1.js, tsa1.js, bot_a.js 

Create a bot

Before an arena server will honor a bee bot connection, each user
needs to have a unique hash key.  The arena server web page
should have a form with a button.  Enter your bee bot name,
click the Create a bot button, a unique hash key will be displayed.
Record that hash key, make sure user bee bot uses that value or
else arena server will not allow bee bot to have any turns.
